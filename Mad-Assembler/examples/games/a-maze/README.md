# A-Maze
Atari 8-bit maze generator

## What is it
This Atari 8-bit assembly program implements the Hunt-and-kill maze generating algorithm from https://github.com/jamis/csmazes

A-Maze was started as a hobby project to try out writing 6502 assembly code for the 8-bit home computer
that started my interest in computers and programming, and later led me into professional career, *Atari 800XL*.

Later I wanted to add some game elements in it. Controlling a character with joystick, and implementing some path
finding and simple opponent AI. Unfortunately I have not had time to implement these.

**Note** There are unfinished code and source files that are waiting for implementation.

## How
The program was developed using Peter Dell's WUDSN IDE https://github.com/peterdell/wudsn-ide  
ASM variant used is MAD-Assembler: http://mads.atari8.info/

## Build
Build obx object file using:  
`mads maze.asm`
